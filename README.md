# 📊 Stock Analysis Project -Internship Project (Month 1)

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on analyzing stock market data to identify trends, visualize patterns, and provide insights for better decision-making. Using Python’s data science libraries, the project extracts meaningful metrics such as moving averages, daily returns, and cumulative returns. It also visualizes stock price movements and compares multiple stocks to highlight performance differences over time.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas & NumPy** – Data manipulation and calculations  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization  
- **Jupyter Notebook / VS Code** – Development environment  

## 📂 Project Structure
```bash
StockAnalysis/
│-- modeltraing/ # Jupyter notebooks for analysis
│-- csv files containg the model and the evaluation metrices
│-- forecast_dashboard.py #the streamlit app

```


## 📑 Key Features
- Import and clean stock market datasets  
- Calculate **daily returns**, **moving averages**, and **cumulative returns**  
- Compare stock performance across multiple companies  
- Create visualizations for better financial insights  


## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Zidio-Internship.git
   ```

Navigate to the project folder:
```bash
cd StockAnalysis
```

Install required dependencies.


📊 Sample Visualizations

Stock price trends over time

Daily returns distribution

Moving averages vs actual stock prices

Cumulative returns comparison across multiple stocks

📈 Insights

## 📈 Insights
This project provides a strong foundation for **financial time-series analysis** by identifying trends, volatility, and seasonal patterns in stock prices. Beyond basic analysis, advanced forecasting models such as **ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet, and LSTM** are implemented to capture both short-term and long-term trends. Seasonality, cyclic behavior, and market irregularities are also analyzed to improve forecasting accuracy. The project can be further extended by integrating **live stock APIs**, developing **real-time dashboards**, and building **predictive trading strategies**.


# Fraud Detection – Internship Project (Month 2)

This repository contains my Zidio Internship Month 2 project on Fraud Detection using machine learning techniques. The project involves data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and a Streamlit dashboard for visualizing predictions. It follows a clean folder structure for reproducibility and scalability.

📂 Folder Structure
```bash

```

🚀 Project Overview

The Fraud Detection system is designed to identify and predict fraudulent activities from transactional data. 

It involves:

Data Preprocessing → Cleaning, normalization, handling missing values (handled via utils/preprocess.py).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) → Conducted in Jupyter notebooks under notebooks/.

Model Training → Implemented models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Deep Learning variants.

Performance Evaluation 

Interactive Dashboard → Built using Streamlit (streamlit_app.py) to visualize fraud detection trends.

⚙️ Installation & Setup

Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sudhanshu3011/Zidio-Internship.git
cd Zidio-Internship/FraudDetection
```


Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # (Linux/Mac)
venv\Scripts\activate      # (Windows)
```


Install dependencies


Run the Streamlit Dashboard:

```bash
cd StockAnalysis
streamlit run forecast_dashboard.py
```

📊 Features

✅ Fraud detection using multiple ML models

✅ Preprocessing utilities for consistent pipelines

✅ Notebook-based experimentation for flexibility

✅ Interactive Streamlit dashboard for visualization

✅ Clean repo structure with .gitignore for large files

### 📌 Notes

The dataset (AIML_Dataset.csv) is not included in this repo due to GitHub’s file size limit.

You can place your dataset inside FraudDetection/data/ and ensure it matches the preprocessing pipeline.

Update .env (if required) with sensitive keys/configurations (ignored in git).
